Interactive visualization of the [Billboard Hot 100](http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) for 2017.

## Overview

Currently there is one static chart for the Hot 100 for 2017, subsetted for songs that have reached top 10 ranking. Hover over any point to see how a song's rank has changed over time.

## Future goals

- add different weekly charts (ex. Pop, Artist 100)
- add/remove weeks from chart
- add/remove songs from chart
